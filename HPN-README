Notes:

BUFFER SIZES:

If HPN is disabled the receive buffer size will be set to the
OpenSSH default of 2MB.

HPN Specific Configuration options

TcpRcvBufPoll=[yes/no] client/server
      enable of disable the polling of the tcp receive buffer through the life
of the connection. You would want to make sure that this option is enabled
for systems making use of autotuning kernels (linux 2.4.24+, 2.6, MS Vista)
default is yes.

HPNDisabled=[yes/no] client/server
     In some situations, such as transfers on a local area network, the impact
of the HPN code produces a net decrease in performance. In these cases it is
helpful to disable the HPN functionality. By default HPNDisabled is set to no.

         by Michael Stevens (mstevens@andrew.cmu.edu). The MT-AES-CTR cipher was
         implemented by Ben Bennet (ben@psc.edu) and improved by Mike Tasota
